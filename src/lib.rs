//! # steam-rs
//!
//! Safe and convenient Rust bindings for the Steam Web API.
//!
//! **Warning**: This crate is still a work in progress. Breaking changes and instability are to be expected. Use with cautionâ€”**this is not production-ready**.
//!
//! The core of this crate is the [`Steam`] struct, which interacts with the Steam Web API. It typically[^1] needs to be initialized with a valid Steam API key.
//!
//! ```
//! use steam_rs::Steam;
//!
//! // Retrieve the Steam API key from an environment variable.
//! let steam_api_key = &std::env::var("STEAM_API_KEY").expect("Missing an API key");
//!
//! // Initialize the Steam API client.
//! let steam = Steam::new(steam_api_key);
//! ```
//!
//! Another key component of this crate is the [`SteamId`](`steam_id::SteamId`) struct. It represents a Steam user ID[^2], which is often used when querying user data.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Here is an example, where the [`Steam`] client requests data about two users using the [`.get_player_summaries(steam_ids)`](`Steam::get_player_summaries()`) method:
//!
//! ```
//! use steam_rs::{steam_id::SteamId, Steam};
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() {
//!     // Get the Steam API Key as an environment variable.
//!     let steam_api_key = &std::env::var("STEAM_API_KEY").expect("Missing an API key");
//!
//!     // Initialize the Steam API client.
//!     let steam = Steam::new(steam_api_key);
//!
//!     // Request the player summaries of SteamIDs `76561198136162943` and `76561197960435530`.
//!     let steam_ids = vec![
//!         SteamId::new(76561198136162943), // Garrett Howard
//!         SteamId(76561197960435530),      // Robin Walker
//!     ];
//!
//!     let player_summaries = steam.get_player_summaries(steam_ids).await.unwrap();
//!
//!     // Print the recieved information about the players.
//!     for player in player_summaries {
//!         println!(
//!             "{:?}'s SteamID is {:?}",
//!             player.persona_name, player.steam_id
//!         )
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [^1]: Not all API endpoints require an API key, and in that case providing one is optional.
//! [^2]: Specifically, [`SteamId`](`steam_id::SteamId`) represents a SteamID64 type, but more types, such as SteamID and SteamID3 are planned in future releases.
